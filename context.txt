**General Form and Appearance:**  
The Ortheans are an advanced, aquatic, water-based species with a distinctly non-Terran morphology suited to their oceanic environment. An adult Orthean typically measures between two and three meters in length. Their overall body shape is streamlined for efficient swimming, reminiscent of terrestrial cephalopods or aquatic vertebrates, yet distinctly alien.

The most striking feature is their six-limbed configuration:
- **Four main limbs** are sleek and muscular, positioned symmetrically for agile locomotion underwater. Each limb ends in webbed, fin-like appendages useful for propulsion and precise control in three-dimensional aquatic space.
- **Two smaller, anterior arms** are highly dexterous and prehensile. These appendages possess multiple slender, jointed digits, allowing for manipulation of tools, delicate technology, or interaction with other organisms.

**Skin and Bioluminescence:**  
Their skin is smooth, rubbery, and covered in a subtle sheen. This surface often displays shifting patterns of bioluminescent light—delicate lines and whorls in blue, green, and violet hues, which pulse or flicker during communication or displays of mood. These light shows can be complex, weaving across the body and limbs with intricate subtlety.

**Sensory and Facial Features:**  
Ortheans have no rigid facial bone structure; their head region flows into the body’s main trunk. A ring of sensitive, membrane-covered structures acts as their primary sensory hub—combining vision (multi-spectrum, including bioluminescent perception), vibration detection, and electroreception. Three slit-like gill openings flank each side of the head, rippling as they breathe and vocalize underwater.

**Distinct Appendages and Technology Integration:**  
Fins or membranous crests run along their back and tail sections, providing additional thrust and balance. Some Ortheans integrate bioengineered accessories, such as organic communication arrays or decorative growths, signifying status within society.

**Communication:**  
Orthean speech is a musical blend of melodic vocalizations and light-based signals via skin bioluminescence. Speech appears as a symphony of underwater tones and ripples of color and light across their bodies, creating a visually mesmerizing and sonically harmonious exchange.

**World Appearance:**  
Veyloris is an ocean-dominated planet, over 95% covered in deep, azure blue waters. From space, it gleams with swirling cloud patterns and glimmering sunlight reflecting off boundless ocean. Huge ocean currents form visible surface patterns, moving around the darker spots of floating cities and kelp superstructures.

**Atmosphere and Climate:**  
The sky above Veyloris is a clear cerulean blue due to its oxygen-rich atmosphere. Cloud banks gather around weather systems, forming spirals, streaks, and sometimes massive, swirling storms. Temperatures are temperate (290 K–310 K), lending a mild, misty ambiance. Rain showers shimmer on the water’s expanse, while pillars of light from the cities and natural bioluminescence glow beneath the surface.

**Major Landmarks and Features:**
- **Floating Cities:** Towering organic domes and interconnected platforms, some miles across, drift gracefully above and below the waves, surrounded by cultivated coral reefs, kelp forests, and luminescent gardens.
- **Great Tidal Rift:** A planetary-scale submarine canyon, home to clusters of glowing marine organisms, shimmering in vibrant purples and blues. The depth creates an eerie vertical abyss, illuminated only by the bioluminescence of curious life forms.
- **Zephis Spire:** A vertical, crystalline observatory that floats near the equator, shaped like a spiral seashell with glowing conduits and observation decks open to the ocean air.

**Moons:**  
- **Thalor:** The larger moon, pale and silver-white, dominating the night sky, its gravitational presence generating powerful tides and ocean currents.
- **Zephis:** A smaller, grayish moon marred by visible dark scars and crater chains. Its irregular shape and impact history are clearly visible, and it has a deep cultural and religious significance for Ortheans.

**Biosphere:**  
Veyloris’s oceans teem with engineered and native aquatic species. Gigantic filter feeders glide through open waters. Schools of neon-lit microfauna swirl in kaleidoscopic patterns. The kelp forests—some tens of kilometers long—form dense, glowing undersea jungles, with organic architecture and intricate ecological symbioses.

**Ecological Manipulation:**  
Ortheans have shaped much of their marine ecosystem for trade use: bred bioluminescent bio-engineered fish swarms, towering kelp for harvest, and docile but massive shellback creatures used for transport and industry.
