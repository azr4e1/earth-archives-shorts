Summary\n\nVeridion is a derelict volcanic world located in the [Helionis Tertia\nsector](/helionis_tertia), orbiting a binary star system. This\nrocky planet has a crushing, sulfur-rich atmosphere with temperatures\nexceeding 900 K, making its surface inhospitable to most forms of life.\nDespite this, CPI Level 0 microbial organisms thrive in the planet\\'s\nacidic clouds, metabolizing sulfur and carbon dioxide in a unique\nsurvival mechanism. Veridion's surface is an ever-shifting wasteland of\nactive volcanoes and molten rivers, with metallic compounds forming\nunusual reflective patterns across its terrain. Lacking moons and other\ncelestial bodies in its system, Veridion stands isolated, its harsh\nenvironment occasionally generating massive electrical storms visible\nfrom orbit. Its binary stars bathe the planet in dual sunsets, creating\na hauntingly beautiful yet hostile landscape.\n\n## 1. Basic Information\n\n- **Sector:** Helionis Tertia\n- **Star System:** Solance Binary System\n- **Planet Position:** Sole planet in the system\n- **Planet Name:** Veridion\n\n## 2. Planet Type\n\n**Type:** Volcanic World\n\n## 3. Number of Moons\n\n**Number of Moons:** None\n\n## 4. Key Moons\n\nKey Moons: None\n\n## 5. Atmospheric Composition\n\n**Atmosphere:** Sulfuric and carbon dioxide-rich, with dense acidic\nclouds\n\n## 6. Temperature Range (in Kelvins)\n\n**Range:** 850 K -- 950 K (Extremely Hot)\n\n## 7. Water Availability\n\n**Availability:** None\n\n## 8. Methane Availability\n\n**Availability:** None\n\n## 9. Life CPI Level\n\n**Level:** CPI Level 0 (Non-sentient microbial life in the atmosphere)\n\n## 10. Biosphere Type\n\n**Type:** Sulfur-based microbial ecosystems in the atmosphere\n\n## 11. Resources\n\n- Sulfuric Compounds\n- Exotic Metals (from volcanic formations)\n- Trace Hydrocarbons\n\n## 12. Trade Value\n\n**Classification:** Neutral Planet\n\nVeridion holds minor scientific interest for its unique atmospheric\nlifeforms and reflective metallic terrains, but its harsh conditions and\nisolation limit its utility.\n\n## 13. Inhabitants\n\n**Species:** None sentient\n\n**Life Forms:** Sulfur-metabolizing microbial organisms suspended in the\ndense acidic clouds. These microbes exhibit resilience to extreme heat\nand acidity, making them a subject of galactic biological studies.\n\n## 14. Landmarks\n\n- **Molten Mirror Fields:** Vast plains of metallic deposits fused\n  into reflective surfaces by extreme volcanic heat, creating dazzling\n  visuals during dual sunsets.\n- **Sulfuric Cyclones:** Massive, slow-moving storm systems in the\n  upper atmosphere, glowing faintly with electrical discharges.\n- **Eternal Pyres:** A network of volcanoes continuously erupting\n  molten sulfur, giving the surface an eerie, glowing appearance from\n  orbit.\n\n## 15. Other Information\n\n**Binary Star Quirk:**\n\nVeridion's binary stars create a rare phenomenon where alternating light\npatterns heat different hemispheres unevenly, causing shifting climatic\nzones across the surface.\n\n**Derelict Status:**",
